Please use W, A, S, D or Arrow keys to move the pacman.

Ghosts will use some behavior to move toward/away from Pac-Man. They won't all use the same behavior

Periodically, a piece of fruit will appear that will be worth 100 points.

Pac-Man does not move when colliding with a wall

Pac-Man should be able to exit one side of the game board and enter in on the other side

When Pac-Man eats the piece of fruit, the fruit disappears

When Pac-Man eats small dots, the dots disappear. Each small dot is 10 points.

When Pac-Man eats large dots, the ghosts turn dark blue and then start flashing (blue and white colors) for a small period of time. Each large dot is 50 points.

If Pac-Man collides with a dark blue or flashing ghost, the ghosts become two eyes and travel quickly to the square box in the middle of the screen. For a single large dot, the first ghost Pac-Man collides with is worth 200, the second is worth 400, the third is worth 800, and the fourth is worth 1600.

if Pac-Man collides with a non dark blue or non-flashing ghost, Pac-Man loses 1 life
Pac-man starts with 3 lives.

The game ends if Pac-Man loses all 3 lives. There should be a "Game Over" message shown on the game.

Pac-Man advances to the next level if Pac-Man eats all the dots before losing 3 lives. Each level should become more difficult.
